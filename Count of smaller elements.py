QUESTION:

Given an sorted array A of size N. Find number of elements which are less than or equal to given element X.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
A[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10}
X = 9
Output:
5
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
A[] = {1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 7, 9}
X = 2
Output:
4
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countOfElements() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer X as inputs and returns the number of elements which are less than or equal to given element.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 
 
 SOLUTION:
 #User function Template for python3

def countOfElements( a, n, x):
    c=0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i]<=x:
            c=c+1
    return c
